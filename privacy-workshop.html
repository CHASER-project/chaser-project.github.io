        <h1>CHASER Workshop on Privacy in Wireless Communications<br> Zürich, Switzerland, October 10, 2025</h1>


        <h2>About the workshop</h2>

        <p>
        Privacy is a major concern in modern communications networks. In particular, user location infornation is considered critical personal information that should be protected.
        Furthermore, the booming technological developments in the field of joint communications and sensing is increasing the amount of potentially personal information being collected by communication devices.
        </p>

        <p>
        However privacy management is a multi-faceted question: end users are often required to share location-related information to specific services which may have legitimate uses of this information (such as providing delivery services, weather forecast, or other services based on geographic context). Radio resource management is another example of application where user location plays a critical role in ensuring efficient network operations.
        Hence, it is critical not only to control what personal information is shared, but to whom, and classical privacy-preserving measures such as end-to-end encryption fall short of delivering the expected protection.
        </p>

        <p>
        The object of the <b>Workshop on Privacy in Wireless Communications</b> is to explore these aspects of privacy in communications networks, with an emphasis on the protection of location and pseudo-location information.
        With 6G networks being standardised with the notion of user-centric data ownership as a central privacy protection mechanism, this event will provide the opportunity to develop a multi-disciplinary understanding of privacy questions in wireless networks.

        The workshop is organized by project <a href="https://chaser-project.github.io/">CHASER</a>, a European project funded under the  <a href="https://www.chistera.eu/">CHIST-ERA</a> initiative and involving <a href="https://www.aalto.fi/en">Aalto University</a>, <a href="https://ethz.ch/en.html">ETH Zürich</a>, <a href="https://inria.fr/en">Inria</a> and the <a href="https://www.uminho.pt/EN">University of Minho</a>, dedicated to enhancing the applicability of self-supervised learning to the physical layer of communications systems. </p>

        <h3>Prof. Mathieu Cunche – Wireless network and personnal data : Challenges, Flaws, and Solutions</h3></div>
        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <p>Mathieu Cunche is a Professor at INSA-Lyon, a member of the
CITI Laboratory, and part of the Inria PRIVATICS project team. His
research focuses on personal data protection and the security of
wireless networks, the Internet of Things (IoT), and mobile systems.
He has led multiple studies demonstrating the leakage of personal data
from mobile devices through Wi-Fi and Bluetooth technologies. He is
actively involved in standardization efforts related to privacy
protection, particularly within the IEEE 802.11 and IETF organizations.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>The proliferation of wireless-enabled devices, such as those utilizing
Bluetooth and Wi-Fi, has revolutionized connectivity but has also
introduced significant privacy vulnerabilities. These technologies
routinely emit unencrypted messages containing identifiers and
technical artifacts, exposing users to potential privacy breaches. In
this work, we investigate the leakage of personal data through these
advertising messages, as well as the efficiency of existing
countermeasures. We present a collection of issues affecting Wi-Fi and
Bluetooth, which allow a passive eavesdropper to infer a flurry of
personal data. We then analyze existing privacy-enhancing mechanisms
and detail the common flaws that undermine their effectiveness.
Our results underscore the urgent need for robust privacy-preserving
mechanisms and the correct implementation of existing protections.
Furthermore, we highlight the pivotal role of standard specifications
in enhancing privacy and advocate for their integration into future
developments.

January 2018 he joined the European Commission as member of the EUROSTAT Task Force on Big
Data. His current interests revolve around the modernisation of official statistics, privacy-preserving
approaches to cross-domain data analytics and analysis of mobile network data for official statistics.


        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>The speaker participates to the workshop in his personal capacity. The information and views set out in the talk are those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the official opinion of the European Commission.</p>
        <p>In this talk I will share a comprehensive personal view of how to approach data protection
aspects. Since everything in life is a matter of definitions, the talk starts from clarifying the
difference and relationship between the notions of “privacy” and “data protection”. We shall
review the ethical motivations for protecting personal data and how the ethical goals have been
translated into legal requirements in the European legislation, i.e., in GDPR. From there, we
will derive guidelines and suggestions for techies – how to embed data protection measures at
the early stages of system conception and design, and what are the costs and main trade-offs
that one could expect.</p>

<p>A central tenet of the talk is that data protection is ultimately an aspect of data governance, and
a well-designed of coherent technological and organisational measures should serve the
purpose of enforcing – not evading – data governance rules.
The talk will also present a critical view of so-called Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs):
starting from the distinction between Input Privacy and Output Privacy problems, we will
review the fundamental limitations (and fallacies) of some recently popularized PETs and how
in principle the “myth” of PETs may have counterproductive societal effects, effectively
weakening rather than strengthening the quest for privacy (“privacy-washing” and PETs as
“Privacy-Elusion Technologies”). In other words, we claim that PETs need to be demystified
in order to be used properly.</p>

<p><b>Note for the attendees:</b> the scope does NOT focus specifically on privacy aspects in wireless
networks or wireless localisation. The scope of the talk being rather general, it is then up to the
attendees to figure out in which way the ideas and messages from the talk apply (or don’t apply)
and particularize to the field of wireless localisation, or any other research topics of their
interest. One possible way of making a good use of the interactive session that follows the
presentation could be, for instance, to have the speakers and participants discuss interactively
how the content of the talk could help to identify a possible solution approach to the
privacy/data protection aspects of channel charting.</p>

        <h3>Prof. Zoran Utkovski – Privacy Aspects of Multi-Point Channel Charting: A System Perspective</h3></div>
        <h4>Bio</h4>
        <p>Zoran Utkovski is a senior researcher at the Fraunhofer Heinrich Hertz Institute in Berlin, Germany, where he heads the Connected Intelligence and Robotics Group. He received a Dipl.-Ing. in electrical engineering (2000) from Sts. Cyril and Methodius University, Skopje, Macedonia, an M.Sc. degree (with distinction) from Chalmers University of Technology in Gothenburg, Sweden (2004), and a Dr.-Ing. Degree (summa cum laude) from Ulm University, Germany (2010). He is recipient of the Fulbright Fellowship and was a visiting scholar at New Jersey Institute of Technology and University Carlos III in Madrid. His research interests are in the areas of communication theory, machine learning, and complex systems theory. Dr. Utkovski is involved in the “6G Research and Innovation Cluster (6G-RIC),” funded by the German Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) and coordinated by Fraunhofer HHI, where he serves as research coordinator of the working groups.</p>

        <h4>Abstract</h4>
        <p>Channel charting (CC) employs dimensionality reduction to channel state information (CSI) collected in multi-antenna wireless systems to provide a low-dimensional representation of the radio environment. In CC, wireless users are assigned pseudo-locations on the channel chart, allowing for localization-related services to be delivered without requiring actual user locations to be estimated. Intuitively, the use of pseudo-location on a channel chart can be perceived as a privacy-preserving feature (user privacy). In practice, however, the study of user privacy requires a more careful examination of the assumptions under which channel charting operates. Besides user privacy, an additional concern may be the exposure of raw CSI measurements for the learning of channel charts which may disclose proprietary information held by hardware vendors to external entities (vendor privacy). Starting from these observations, we discuss some of the privacy threats associated with CC, with the aim of obtaining a nuanced understanding of the system aspects and privacy implications inherent to CC.</p>
